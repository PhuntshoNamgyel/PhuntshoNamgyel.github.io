This blog is all about my learning journey through six important units of my course. Each post will focus on what I’ve learned, why it matters, and how it’s helping me grow.

What You’ll Find Here:
* Key Takeaways – The most important lessons from each unit.
* Why It Matters – How these concepts apply in real life.
* Personal Reflections – My thoughts and growth along the way.

This blog is a way for me to reflect on my learning and share insights with others. I hope you find it interesting and maybe even helpful!

Let’s dive in!
